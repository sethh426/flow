# Current State — 2026-10-04

Baseline: `main` at `af6ee9bb6c83fd0c5a05a685e9d12324c93526e1`, the merge of the floating studio work.

## Verified from current source

- Flow's primary client is Next.js 15 / React 19.
- The visible product entry surface is now the floating Flow studio rather than the recovered dashboard.
- A brief can produce an editable creative package and local vertical video/ZIP workflow.
- Local production supports uploaded images/audio, draft persistence, editable JSON import/export and video rendering.
- Focused studio TypeScript/lint gates and backend tests are wired into root checks/CI.
- Root Firebase configuration selects `services/neural-orchestrator` as the functions source.
- Firebase runtime configuration can fall back to Hosting's public initialization JSON.
- AI creation is designed to require Firebase auth plus a server-held `FLOW_STUDIO_OPENAI_KEY` and explicit `FLOW_STUDIO_MODEL`.

## Strong evidence, not full production proof

- Focused studio/browser/backend tests exist and the merged documentation reports them passing before merge.
- The selected studio backend has quota/concurrency controls and stricter validation.
- Secret handling has been improved compared with historical recovered services.

## Unproven / incomplete

- A successful live authenticated provider generation in staging/production.
- Server-backed media/project persistence.
- Synthesized narration.
- Generated live-action/cinematic footage from external video providers.
- Durable multi-step workflow execution with provider-confirmed retries/idempotency.
- Production publishing connectors.
- Closed-loop performance optimization using real conversion/retention evidence.
- Whole-repository type/lint/security cleanliness.
- Consolidation of overlapping historical orchestrators/services.
- A single current cost model across providers.

## Highest-leverage constraint

Flow can create a local creative package, but it cannot yet reliably execute the complete hidden production pipeline behind one button. The next vertical slice should make one request become a durable job that can plan, generate narration/visual media, render, persist artifacts, expose progress/recovery, and stop for explicit approval before external publishing.
